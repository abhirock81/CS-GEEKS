# CS-GEEKS
This is basically an idea in which a student can learn basic programming languages like C,C++,Java etc.
I have integrated youtube API to this app so user don't need to waste time on searching best lectures from youtube as they can directly learn from my app.
After completion of each topic user can play quiz to test their knowledge.
This app is basically a prototype as I have to update many things like more languages to learn,improving UI.
Feel free to update this app it will really helps me .
